                    <h3>Character creation</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to start adventuring, you will need a character to represent you in the cursed planes. This character can be customizable with the basics like:
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>Name</span> and <span>age</span></li>
                            <li><span>Race:</span> The race will grant you specific bonuses to aid you in many situations.</li>
                            <li><span>Class:</span> The class will determine what your character especializes in doing. For instance, some classes are more favoured in the arcane arts, some others in a martial style.</li>
                            <li><span>Background:</span> A background will help round up the backstory of your character as well as grant them extra bonuses and items.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have customized the basics, you will need to determine your character's stats. Don't worry! I have taken the care to make it easy for beginners in TTRPGs (Tabletop Roleplaying Games).
                        You will be given 6 different numbers that you will need to assign to each different stat. Each number has an associated bonus that will help you determine whether you success or fail in doing something.
                        For example: Val'ehdan has a STRENGTH of 15 (+3) and a DEXTERITY of 10(+0). Val'ehdan is capable of lifting a heavy stone door without the help of his friends, but he won't be so swift to avoid being hit by the enemies attack, because he is slow.
                        If you are a more experienced or bold player, then you are more than welcome to roll up your stats! I have implemented a way to randomize the roll of the dice. You can choose any method you want to do it.
                        If you'd rather use a point-buying system, that is perfectly doable, too.
                    </p>
                    <h3>So you've rolled up your character... now what?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the Stories section you can find a plethora of adventures to play. Just choose whatever piques your interest and select a chapter. You will automatically be assigned an appropiate level, so don't worry about that.
                        Inside each chapter you have a story before you, that will unfold differently with each decision you make. Be wise and careful! The consequences of your actions cannot be undone and facing death might be a most regrettable choice if you are underprepared.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you start reading the adventure, you will eventually come to a point where you can act upon your environment or the ones present with you in the game. You will find different buttons from which you will have to pick one to move the story forward.
                        Once you've clicked the action button, a new part of the stoy will be unlocked and you'll be able to continue adventuring. If you want to replay a chapter or adventure, you can always select it from the Stories section or create a new character.
                    </p>
